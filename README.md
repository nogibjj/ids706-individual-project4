## Individual Project #4: Auto Scaling Flask App Using Any Serverless Platform
### Requirements
For this assignment, you will build a publicly accessible auto-scaling container using Azure App Services and Flask. This is an easy way to build and deploy a scaleable web-hosted app and will allow you to apply your Flask knowledge from previous lessons.

### Your project will be graded on the following criteria:
- A README.md file (15 points): This should clearly explain what the project does, its dependencies, how to run the program, and conclude with actionable and data-driven recommendations to a hypothetical management team.
    - Clarity and completeness of README: 10 points
    - Quality of conclusion and recommendation: 5 points
- GitHub Repo (20 points): A complete GitHub Repo that contains all required scripts and documentation to run your application.
- Flask App (20 points):
    - Functionality within Docker/(Platform): 10 points
    - Creativity/sophistication, full credit (all 20 points for this section) will be given to students who have a functioning embedded LLM within Flask: 10 points.
- Use of DockerHub (Or equivalent) (10 points): Hosting your functioning container on DockerHub.   
- Azure Web App (Or equivalent) (15 points): Successfully deploying your container via Azure Web App to a public endpoint. This can be done either directly from Docker or through Azure container registry.
- Video Demo (20 points): A YouTube link in README.md showing a clear, concise (2-5min) walkthrough and demonstration of your application. The video should be high-quality (both audio and visual), not exceed the given time limit, and be linked in the README via a private or public YouTube link.
    - Clarity of explanation: 8 points
    - Quality demonstration of the project: 7 points
    - Quality of video and audio: 5 points
